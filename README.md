### Nostr-enabled Apps

  - needs plugin for controlling admin API for live event publishing from owncast
- [Owncast](https://github.com/owncast/owncast) - single user live video streaming and chat server for running your own live streams.
  - needs kind 30311 live event broadcasting + chat API into ribbit
- [chitchatter](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/chitchatter) - secure peer-to-peer chat that is serverless, decentralized, and ephemeral 

### Nostr
